## Resubmission

This is a resubmission (based on feedback received on 29th Sept). In this version I have:

- Removed "R" from the package title in the DESCRIPTION file.
- Provided a more descriptive package title and description in the DESCRIPTION file.
- Added more examples in the Rd files for those functions/R6 classes that are exported and used directly by users of the package.  Many fuller examples can also be found in the package vignettes.

## Background

This is the 1st version of a new package.
This package is written entirely in R with no external dependencies/components other than the packages listed in the DESCRIPTION file.
Development approach is aligned with practices described in:
http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/
