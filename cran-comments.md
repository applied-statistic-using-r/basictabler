  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    data   3.8Mb
    doc    2.1Mb

Unsure of reason for discrepancy between Local R CMD and Travis-CI CMD check results. The sample data has been compressed into three rda files, total size 1 MB. Different compression options were explored and the option chosen that resulted in the smallest files.

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes
